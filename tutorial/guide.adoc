THIS IS A TUTORIAL

* <<control>>
** Example: build a hardware remote to set a timer, use a small hardware device to
add GPS information or other tags. Media is manually uploaded to YouTube
or Facebook by photographer or script automatically uploads media using
https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_uploading_videos?hl=en[YouTube API].
* <<backend>>
** Example: mobile app takes image then sends information to server to process
and display on webpage using embedded third-party image viewer
or plays video on existing site such as YouTube, Facebook.
* <<vr>>
** Example: Viewing and then controlling the 360 degree media with an application you build
yourself.

[[control]]
=== Before You Begin
There's many types of applications you can build to control the camera. If you're
just getting started with 360 images, I recommend you focus on building
an application to control the camera. You can extend the application to move
media from the camera to an external storage device for processing later or
to a third-party site such as YouTube, Facebook, or Google+.

image::img/guide/api_app.png[Idea for application to control the camera]

Here are some ideas from the community.

* *Security*: Take 360 images (not video) at set intervals. Transfer
images from camera to external storage device. The image is already in
equirectangular format. Apply your own algorithm to identify objects.
** Key APIs: https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/commands/camera.take_picture.html[`camera.takePicture`],
https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/commands/camera.list_images.html[`camera.listImages`],
https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/commands/camera.get_image.html[`camera.getImage`],
https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/options/remaining_pictures.html[`remainingPictures`]

* *Accident*: Attach THETA to a camera platform
rigged to a commercial truck or a sign post near a dangerous crossing
such as a train crossing.
In the event of a traffic accident, a 360 degree image taken.

* *Historical Site*: Use a drone or autonomous vehicle to
take images of sites and apply tagging.

* *Additional Functionality*
** Add a timer delay to the camera
** Create a remote control feature
** Take four images at once using four cameras and four small devices like
a Raspberry Pi, each with a WiFi USB adapter. Trigger the images
simultaneously using the GPIO pins of the Pi.

[[backend]]
=== Ideas for Back-end Server Media Management
In this scenario, you build a web site that hosts 360 images or video.
You then build a mobile app that connects to THETA and takes the image
and uploads it to your special server. Example uses are real estate,
sporting event, music festival, travel.

image::img/guide/realestate.png[Real estate application]

A basic mockup of this concept built by a high school student
is available http://kaiyotesoft.github.io/realEstate/dynamic.html[here].
The purpose is to show you how easy it is to start building
your own site with a JavaScript open source viewer and a basic
http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap] template.
The site, including the source code for the
viewer software, is available as a
https://github.com/KaiyoteSoft/realEstate[GitHub repository],
gh-pages branch.

The mockup of the controller is based on an existing Python/Pygame
application that was described in the
http://codetricity.github.io/theta-s/[Unofficial API Guide]. Full
source code available.

IMPORTANT: The mobile app will not be able to connect to the
THETA and Internet WiFi at the same time. You may need to
disconnect the phone to THETA connection before connecting
to the Internet.

NOTE: The THETA becomes a WiFi server with IP address
192.168.1.1 The IP address is not designed to be changed.

If your application has a mobile component, you should download the
https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/sdk/[official RICOH SDK]
for Android or iOS applications.

You can extend this concept to make the images or video viewable
inside of a headset for an immersive experience. The easiest way to
get a demo with 360 video up and running is to use an existing
application such as YouTube to display the media.

If you want to embed a 360 image into your web application, you can look
at one of these existing applications:

* http://ggnome.com/pano2vr[Pano2VR]: Commerical. Pano2VR is an application to convert
spherical or cylindrical panoramic images into HTML5,
Flash, or QuickTime VR (QTVR) panoramas with features such as customizable
skins, tour building, multiresolution (gigapixel panorama), hotspots
and directional sound. There is a demo available. The image with the
demo will have a watermark.
* https://www.holobuilder.com/index.html[HoloBuilder]: Free.
HoloBuilder is a f
ree web platform that lets you create 360° and virtual reality content.
Build virtual tours from your 360° photospheres and enhance them with 3D objects.
Embed images right into your website using holo player.
Based on WebGL, HoloBuilder runs on any modern web browser on any device.
HoloBuilder was the RICOH THETA developer content grand prize winner.
The application is free to use.
* http://krpano.com/[krpano]: Commercial.
Viewer for panoramic images and interactive
virtual tours. The viewer is available as Flash and HTML5 application.
The viewer is designed for the usage inside the Browser on Desktop
(Windows, Mac, Linux) and on Mobiles/Tablets (iPhone, iPad, Android, ...).
In addition to the krpano Viewer there are the krpano Tools - small tools
and droplets which help to prepare the panoramic images for viewing
and make them ready-to-use. Making a pano or a tour is possible just
by drag-and-drop. Commercial product. Demo available.

Other ideas. The camera could be distributed
to influencers at a travel event like Las Vegas casino opening and a special web
platform could
aggregate and create 360 experiences using an existing front-end system.

[[vr]]
=== Ideas for VR Headsets

image::img/guide/immersive.png[Immersive Experience]

The THETA cannot stream video over WiFi. You can use
https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/commands/camera._get_live_preview.html[`camera._getLivePreview`]
to get a live view. This only works in still image capture mode, not video mode.

You can use
https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/commands/camera.take_picture.html[`camera.takePicture`] to
take the picture and
https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/commands/camera.get_image.html[`camera.getImage`] to
transfer the image from the camera to the headset.

In most cases, the headset will be a mobile phone that is inside of a cardboard
holder. If you're targeting a mobile phone, you can use the examples in the
official https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/sdk/[RICOH SDK].

IMPORTANT: In most cases, your application should target a still image.
Although the THETA can stream live video from the camera's USB port,
the output is in dual-fisheye mode (two spheres). Desktop software
on Mac or PC can stitch the dual-fisheye videos into equirectangular
format so that it can be viewed on the mobile phone. This is a manual
process and the video is saved to disk.
You could build a mobile app that displays a catalog of
pre-recorded videos for display in a headset.

NOTE: At CES, RICOH demonstrated live streaming of stiched video.
This software is not yet available for public use (as of 1/27).
RICOH is not able to disclose lens distortion data.

The RICOH THETA S does support
https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/commands/camera._get_live_preview.html[`camera.getLivePreview`]
in still image mode. This outputs binary equirectangular MotionJPEG for Live View.

According the
https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/introduction/[RICOH site],
the image size for Live View is
640x320 and the frame rate is 10fps.

It might be theoretically possible to use LivePreview to show MotionJPEG at
low resolution and then trigger a high-resolution 360 image for transfer
to the headset. You may encounter problems with the delay.


== https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/sdk/[The Official SDK]
If you're building a mobile app or using Java, you should definitely
download and study the official SDK.

The easiest place to get started is to look at the `network` section of the SDK.
For Android, the docs are in:

  RICOH_THETA_v2_SDK_for_Android.0.1.0/RICOH_THETA_v2_SDK_for_Android.0.1.0/ricoh-theta-sample-for-androidv2/doc/index.html

Here's a taste of what the SDK offers for controlling the camera.

  ImageData getImage(java.lang.String fileId, HttpDownloadListener listener)
  Acquire raw data of specified image

  ImageSize getImageSize()
  Acquire currently set shooting size

  java.util.ArrayList<ImageInfo> getList()
  Acquire list of media files on device

  private java.util.ArrayList<ImageInfo> getListInternal(int maxReceiveEntry, java.lang.String token)
  Acquire media file list (limited number of items)

  java.io.InputStream getLivePreview()
  Acquire live view stream

  private java.lang.String getState()
  Acquire device status

  StorageInfo getStorageInfo()
  Acquire storage information of device

  Bitmap getThumb(java.lang.String fileId)
  Acquire thumbnail image

Hopefully, at this stage I've enticed you to open up the official SDK and
see if it meets your needs.

The SDK covers display and navigation of media. It does not cover video
streaming.


== Working with 360 Degree Media
The https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/sdk/[official RICOH SDK] is a
great place to start to understand how to
work with 360 degree media.

To help you start your amazing app quickly, we've also started collecting
community information in
an unofficial media guide.

* http://theta360developers.github.io/community-document/community.html[THETA Developers Unofficial Media Guide]

== Additional Application Ideas
These are ideas brought up by the community. We do not know if they are feasible.
As far as we know, no one has successfully built these applications.

=== Shooting 4 Images Simultaneously To Capture a Large Area
image::img/guide/4camera.png[4 Camera Rig Concept]

This concept was submitted by a professional VR photographer, but has not
been built yet. I've adapted the concept with my own idea of using
Raspberry Pi units.

Materials:

* 4 Raspberry Pi units. Cheap ones fine. Processing power not important.
* 4 USB WiFi dongles
* 8 wires to connect to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi
* Frame or board to mount the Raspberry Pi units together as a single
transportable unit
* Physical electrical button
* Portable power supply for the Raspberry Pis (battery)

Pointers:

* https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/[Adafruit GPIO Setup Guide for Raspberry Pi]
* https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/options/_wlan_channel.html[`_wlanChannel`] option to set WiFi channel of camera if you encounter interference
* http://codetricity.github.io/theta-s/[Unofficial API guide] with Raspberry Pi section and Python code examples

=== Live Streaming with External Hardware
image::img/guide/streamer.png[External unit for live streaming]

The winner of the last TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon won the RICOH THETA
prize for streaming video using an Android device and sending the video to
an external server for stitching.

I built a similar device using a Raspberry Pi that could stream dual-fisheye
video. Streaming dual-fisheye video to an external server over
WiFi from a device connected to the THETA is fairly easy. It
will probably take you less than an hour. Different groups of people have
then got the stitching to work, though there are gaps in the edges of the
video that
are noticeable. You probably can't get rid of the gaps without
confidential information that RICOH can't release to the public.

The other thing to consider is that RICOH demoed live streaming and
stitched video at CES in January over USB. Thus, it seems likely
there will be an official solution coming out in the future
that solves the stitching problem.

However, this is still an interesting idea that could work to
prototype a concept as you wait for the supporting technology to mature.

image::img/guide/streamer2.png[Official RICOH USB driver for livestreaming]

It's important to note that the resolution of the stitched video may be
lower than what you need for actual use. It's for experimentation and
prototyping with equipment you may already have around your studio.

Update: 2/10/2016. The
http://theta360developers.github.io/community-document/community.html[Unofficial Media Guide]
has an image and video of
a demo of the official RICOH live streaming USB driver with stitching. The
driver is not available to the public yet and may not be available at the
Feb 13 hackathon.


== Next Steps
If you're interested in testing out the API, I suggest you read the
http://codetricity.github.io/theta-s/[Unofficial API Guide]. Have fun!
